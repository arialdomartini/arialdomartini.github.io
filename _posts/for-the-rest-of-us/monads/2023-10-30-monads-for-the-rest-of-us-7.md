## In which you discover that Bind is a combinator<br/> and you feel illuminated

If you want to understand Functors, it helps to develop a little different intuition on Monads. And in order to do so, it helps to go back to the roots. Don't worry, it will take only few seconds.

Imagine you have 2 ordinary functions:

```haskell
f :: A -> B
g :: B -> C
```

![2 type-compatible ordinary functions](static/img/monads-for-the-rest-of-us/ordinary-functions-2-functions.png){: height="300px" }

You know that they are type-compatible: the output of `f` has the same type of the input of `g`. So you can both:

* *Apply* `f` to the output of `g`.
* *Compose* `f` and `g` and build a new function `g . f`.

![2 type-compatible ordinary functions composed](static/img/monads-for-the-rest-of-us/ordinary-functions-2-functions-composed.png){: height="300px" }

Ok, we are done with the roots. I promised it would be fast.  
Let's see now what happens with monadic functions. Suppose you have:

```haskell
f :: A -> Monad<B>
g :: B -> Monad<C>
```

![2 monadic functions](static/img/monads-for-the-rest-of-us/monadic-functions-2-functions.png){: height="300px" }

They are not type-compatible: the output of `f` has a different type than the type requested by `g`. You cannot just feed `g` with the output of `f`:

![2 monadic functions cannot be directly bound](static/img/monads-for-the-rest-of-us/monadic-functions-2-functions-cannot-be-bound.png){: height="300px" }

Your problem is: you would like to feed `f` with a value of `A`, but you don't have it; instead, you have a value of `Monad<A>`.  
You also know that the solution is the function `bind`.

```csharp
Monad<B> Bind<A, B>(Func<A, Monad<B>> f, Monad<A> a) => ...
```

that is, a function with the signature:

```haskell
//             f            input   =>  output
bind :: (A -> Monad<B>) -> Monad<A> -> Monad<B>
```

Here's the little new intuition you have to develop: instead of seeing to `bind` as the function to feed `f` with `input` to get an `output`, that is, as the monadic version of `Apply`, imagine surronding the last 2 elements in parenthesis:


```haskell
//             f        => (  input   -> output   )
bind :: (A -> Monad<B>) -> ( Monad<A> -> Monad<B> )
```


Graphically: you start from a monadic function `f`:

![a monadic function from A to Monad B](static/img/monads-for-the-rest-of-us/monadic-functions-before-bind.png){: height="300px" }

and this is what you get applying `bind`:

![a monadic function f from Monad A to Monad B](static/img/monads-for-the-rest-of-us/monadic-functions-after-bind.png){: height="300px" }


That is: imagine `bind` as that function that, given a function:

```haskell
f :: A -> Monad<B>
```

transforms it so its type signature becomes:

```haskell
f' :: Monad<A> -> Monad<B>
```

You like `f'` a lot! Remember your problem?

> You would like to feed `f` with a value of `A` but you don't have it;   
> instead, you have a value of `Monad<A>`.

That's perfect: the function `bind` gave you back a function that wants a `Monad<A>` as input. `bind` solved your problem.

Here's the gist. `bind` transforms a series of not type-compatible monadic functions:

![a series of monadic functions](static/img/monads-for-the-rest-of-us/monadic-functions-series-of-functions.png){: width="100%" }

lifting their input types so that they can be *bound* and composed together:

![a series of monadic functions with bind applied](static/img/monads-for-the-rest-of-us/monadic-functions-series-of-bound-functions.png){: width="100%" }

In other words: you know there are benefits in working in the monadic world; `bind` takes those function that are still with one of their legs in the ordinary world and it elevates them.

Completing this with `return` and `run`, it's intuitive to think that the core pattern adopted in programming functionally with monads is the following:

![return + bound functions + run](static/img/monads-for-the-rest-of-us/functional-programming-with-monads.png){: width="100%" }

* You start by elevating your input value to the monadic world with `return`.
* You process it with a series of monadic functions, bound with `Bind`.
* And finally, at the edge of your application, you descend down to the world of ordinary functions and values, with `run`.

# Show me the code or shut up!
Remember the implementation of `Bind` for the IO Monad?

```csharp
IO<B> Bind<A, B>(this Func<A, IO<B>> f, IO<A> a) => 
    new(() => f(a.Run()).Run());
```

Its signature is

```haskell
(A -> IO<B>) -> IO<A> -> IO<B>
```

To make it implement:

```haskell
(A -> IO<B>) -> (IO<A> -> IO<B>)
```

you just have to move the `IO<A> a` parameter out of the function parameters, and to adapt the returning type:

```csharp
Func<IO<A>, IO<B>> Bind<A, B>(this Func<A, IO<B>> f) => (IO<A> a) =>
        new(() => f(a.Run()).Run());
```
The implementation needn't change.  
Similarly, for the `Maybe` monad, the original `Bind`:

```csharp
Maybe<B> Bind<A, B>(Func<A, Maybe<B>> f, Maybe<A> a) =>
    a.Run(
        just: a => f(a),
        nothing: () => new Nothing<B>());
```

can be rewritten as:

```csharp
Func<Maybe<A>, Maybe<B>> Bind<A, B>(Func<A, Maybe<B>> f) => (Maybe<A> a) =>
    a.Run(
        just: a => f(a),
        nothing: () => new Nothing<B>());
```

Notice that they don't need to be methods of a monad instance, as they don't depend on a value anymore. They can be easily static, or even Extension Methods of `Func`:

```csharp
internal static class MaybeExtensions
{
    internal static Func<Maybe<A>, Maybe<B>> Bind<A, B>(this Func<A, Maybe<B>> f) => (Maybe<A> a) =>
        a.Run(
            just: a => f(a),
            nothing: () => new Nothing<B>());
}
```

Here's how it is used:

```csharp
Func<string, Maybe<int>> length = s =>
    s == null
        ? new Nothing<int>()
        : new Just<int>(s.Length);

// here we are elevating the function
var elevatedLength = length.Bind();

// so we can feed it with a monadic value
Maybe<int> monadicResult = elevatedLength(Return("foo"));

var result = monadicResult switch
{
    Nothing<int> => "got nothing",
    Just<int> { Value: int value } => $"got a {value}"
};

Assert.Equal("got a 6!", result);
```

Notice how the code uses `switch` as the native way to run the monad.

# Functors
Take a break. It was a short but intense journey. Ruminate on this intuition, give yourself the time to assimilate the notion of `bind` as a combinator.

You are ready to understand Functors: it will be a matter of defining a different combinator: `map`.

Proceed to [Chapter 8](monads-for-the-rest-of-us-8).
