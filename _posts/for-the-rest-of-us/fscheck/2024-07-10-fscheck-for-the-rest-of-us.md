Learning to use FsCheck in C#, the easy way, for abolute noobs. A version with F# will follow.

If you are completely new to Monads, the ticket to get you in the loop
could be the gentle introduction of [Monads for the Rest of
Us][monads-for-the-rest-of-us] which uses C# examples. This series,
instead, uses F# and is only slightly more challenging.  
Nonetheless, no previous knowledge of F# is needed, neither is
understanding of monads. In fact, the series starts from the scratch
and builds an intuition on State Monad from the very ground up.

## Table of chapters
* [Chapter 1](state-monad-for-the-rest-of-us-1): in which you play
  with recursive types and recursive functions.

Enjoy the journey!
