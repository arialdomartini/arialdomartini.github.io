Until this point, we have worked with these types:

```fsharp
type ParseError = string
type Input = string
type Rest = string

type Parser<'a> = Input -> Result<'a, Rest, ParseError>
```

So defined, `Parser` is a type alias. It's a good idea to improve the
encapsulation wrapping the function on the right side in a Single-case
Discriminated Union:

```fsharp
type Parser<'a> = Parser of (Input -> Result<'a * Rest, ParseError>)
```

Note the `Parser of` case constructor. We can also grant
`Result<Rest * 'a, ParseError>` the dignity of its own type,
independent from `Result`:

```fsharp
type ParseResult<'a> =
    | Success of ('a * Rest)
    | Failure of ParseError

type Parser<'a> = Parser of (Input -> 'a ParseResult)
```

So defined, the details about passing `rest` and handling errors are
not directly visible from the outside. Good for information hiding.  A
drawback of having the function wrapped inside `Parser`, though, is
that you can't direcly apply it to a string input anymore. A helper
function will come in handy:

```fsharp
let run (p: 'a Parser) (input: string)=
    match p with
    | Parser f -> f input


type SomeType =
    | One
    | Two
    | Three

[<Fact>]
let ``runs a parser`` () =
    let mockParser = Parser(fun _ -> Success(One, "rest"))

    test <@ run mockParser "any input" = Success(One, "rest") @>
```

Actually, you can simplify `run` as:

```fsharp
let run (Parser f) input =
    f input
```

If you think to `Parser` as a container, you can imagine `run` as the
function that *opens* it and reveals its content. This is a common
theme when working with monads: even if monads are not boxes &mdash;
nor burritos &mdash; sometimes the idea of *opening a monad*,
operating with its content, and then *wrapping* the result back in
another monad comes in handy.  
Fine. The `Parser` type and the `run` function are an excellent
starting point.

## A Grammar For A Parsing Language

Let's give a look to the ending point, too. Over the course of the
next chapters, we will develop several functions and operators. They
will form the syntactic elements of a grammar with which you'll be
able to build whatever parser.

Let me list them below so you know right away where we're headed.

Don't feel overwhelmed. They are way easier to write than they appear
at first.  
As a starter, we will build `|>>` and `<<|`.

## From The F# Native Function Application...
Our goal is to develop an alternative to the F# native function
application that, under the hood, takes care of passing `rest` around
and of handling errors. This bears the question: what's the native F#
function application, to begin with?

```fsharp
[<Fact>]
let ``function application`` () =
    let twice x = x * 2

    test <@ twice 42 = 84 @>
```

Do you see that whitespace between `twice` and `42`?

```fsharp
twice 42
     ^
```

With a bit of fantasy, you can imagine that this is an actual
operator: it applies `twice` to the value `42`. If it were a real
operator, its signature would be:

```fsharp
val ( ) : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b
```

This is fictional code, though: a whitespace cannot be used as an
operator name. But wait a moment! F# *does provide* an actual operator
with that exact signature! It's `<|`. If you were to write it
manually, you would have:

```fsharp
let (<|) (f: 'a -> 'b) (a: 'a) : 'b = f a

[<Fact>]
let ``function application, via an operator`` () =
    let twice x = x * 2

    test <@ twice <| 42 = 84 @>
```

Its real implementation ([FSharp.Core/prim-types.fs#L4546][apply-source]) is:

```fsharp
let inline (<|) func arg1 = func arg1
```

Almost identical! Oh, that feeling when a reimplementation matches the
original! So gratifying...  
`<|` is the same of the famous pipe operator `|>`, only with flipped
parameters. Let's reinvent `|>` too:


```fsharp
let (|>) (a: 'a) (f: 'a -> 'b) : 'b = f a

[<Fact>]
let ``function application with pipe`` () =
    let twice x = x * 2

    test <@ 42 |> twice = 84 @>
```

`|>` is actually defined like this in the F# code ([FSharp.Core/prim-types.fs#L4540][pipe-source]):

```fsharp
let inline (|>) arg func = func arg
```

## ...To A Parser-Powered Function Application

If we want to define a parser-powered function application, don't we
just need to change the signature of `<|` to accept an `'a Parser`
instead of just an `'a`? Good question. Let's see. We can try to
define 2 enhanced operators:


| F# native | Parser-powered |
|-----------|----------------|
| `<|`      | `<<|`          |
| `|>`      | `|>>`          |


with these signatures:

| Version        | Operator | Signature                       |
|----------------|----------|---------------------------------|
| F# native      | `<|`     | `('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b` |
| Parser-powered | `<<|`    | `('a -> 'b) -> 'a Parser -> 'b` |

and:

| Version        | Operator | Signature                       |
|----------------|----------|---------------------------------|
| F# native      | `|>`     | `'a        -> ('a -> 'b) -> 'b` |
| Parser-powered | `|>>`    | `'a Parser -> ('a -> 'b) -> 'b` |



```fsharp
let (<<|) (f: 'a -> 'b) (a: 'a Parser) : 'b = __

let (|>>) (a: 'a Parser) (f: 'a -> 'b) : 'b = __

// A never-failing mock parser always returning 42
let p42: int Parser =
    Parser (fun _ -> Success(42, "rest"))

[<Fact>]
let ``parser-powered function application`` () =
    let twice x = x * 2

    test <@ twice <<| p42 = 84 @>
    test <@ p42 |>> twice = 84 @>
```

But this is a complete nonsense! Think about it: an `int Parser` is
not an `int` value; it's *a promise* of an `int`. Put your ear up to
it and you'll hear it whispering:

> True, I am not an actual value myself. But I promise I can provide you with one.  
> Just feed me with an input string: I will do my best to parse it
> and, if I don't fail, I will eventually give you back that
> much-desired `int` value.

To keep the metaphor going, if `twice <<| p42` could speak, it would
tell you:

> I see what you want to do! You want to multiply some integer 
> value by `2`.  
> You know that we don't have that integer value just yet; you also
> know we will eventually obtain one as soon as you feed with an input
> string.
>
> Let's make a deal: pass me the calculation you want to run. I will
> parse that input string for you, then I will apply that function. I
> promise.
>
> I mean: you gave me a Parser, I pay you back with
> another Parser. It's only fair.

This means that the signature of our enhanced operators should rather
be:


| Version        | Operator | Signature                       |
|----------------|----------|---------------------------------|
| F# native      | `<|`     | `('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b` |
| Parser-powered | `<<|`    | `('a -> 'b) -> 'a Parser -> 'b Parser` |

and:

| Version        | Operator | Signature                              |
|----------------|----------|----------------------------------------|
| F# native      | `|>`     | `'a        -> ('a -> 'b) -> 'b`        |
| Parser-powered | `|>>`    | `'a Parser -> ('a -> 'b) -> 'b Parser` |


Since both `<<|` and `|>>` now return a `'b Parser`, the assertions:

```fsharp
test <@ twice <<| p42 = 84 @>
test <@ p42 |>> twice = 84 @>
```

will not compile. We cannot compare the returned `'b Parser` with
`84`. Is a sense, you got back a future, successfully parsed `84`
wrapped in a box. You need `run` to unwrap it:

```fsharp
test <@ run (twice <<| p42) "some input" = Success ("rest", 84) @>
test <@ run (p42 |>> twice) "some input" = Success ("rest", 84) @>
```

Putting all together:

```fsharp
let (<<|) (f: 'a -> 'b) (a: 'a Parser) : 'b Parser = __

let (|>>) (a: 'a Parser) (f: 'a -> 'b) : 'b Parser = __

let p42: int Parser =
    Parser (fun _ -> Success(42, "rest"))

[<Fact>]
let ``parser-powered function application`` () =
    let twice x = x * 2

    test <@ run (twice <<| p42) "some input" = Success(84, "rest") @>
    test <@ run (p42 |>> twice) "some input" = Success(84, "rest") @>
```

It compiles.  
Now that we are armed with a failing test, we are ready to implement
`|>>` and `<<|`. Not only can you be driven by tests: types can drive
you too. Listen to the signature:

```fsharp
let (<<|) (f: 'a -> 'b) (ap: 'a Parser) : 'b Parser = ...
```

It tells us to return an instance of `Parser`. Fine, let's obey. We
need to invoke the `Parser` case constructor:

```fsharp
let (<<|) (f: 'a -> 'b) (ap: 'a Parser) : 'b Parser =
    Parser ...
```

What does the case constructor want as an argument? A function from an
input `string` to something. Fine, type system, I trust you:

```fsharp
let (<<|) (f: 'a -> 'b) (ap: 'a Parser) : 'b Parser =
    Parser (fun input ->
        ...)
```

Now:

- If you want to return a `'b Parser` you have to obtain a `'b` value.
- The only way to get one is through `f`, which is an `'a -> 'b`.
- In order to invoke `f` you need an `'a` value.
- Damn. You don't have it. You have a parser of `'a`, instead, so
  something that can give you an `'a` value, if only you run it with a
  `string` input.
- But look! You do have a `string` input, because you live inside a
  lambda!
- So, just *run* `ap` with `input` and you will get an `a
  ParseResult`. If it is successful, you will find the `'a` value
  there, together with the unconsumed input.
- (If it fails, you are safe to let `<<|` fail too).
- With the obtained `'a` value, you can finally invoke `f`, and get a
  `'b` value.
- You can wrap the `'b` value and the unconsumed value in a tuple, and
  finally return it, successfully.

Let's translate all of this to code:

```fsharp
let (<<|) (f: 'a -> 'b) (ap: 'a Parser) : 'b Parser =
    Parser (fun input ->
        let ar : 'a ParseResult = run ap input
        match ar with
        | Success (a, rest) -> Success (f a, rest)
        | Failure s -> Failure s )
```

Relying on type inference, you can simplify this to:

```fsharp
let (<<|) f ap =
    Parser (fun input ->
        match run ap input with
        | Success (rest, a) -> Success (rest, f a)
        | Failure s -> Failure s )
        
let (<<|) f ap =
    Parser (fun input ->
        match run ap input with
        | Success (a, rest) -> Success (f a, rest)
        | Failure s -> Failure s )
```

Not bad! And not too difficult, after all. This function is
interesting because it captures the *effectful logic*:

- It passes the unconsumed input forward.
- It deals with failures.

It does not contain any logic other than this. It really keeps
concerns separate:

- `f` encapsulates the actual domain logic.
- `<<|` encapsulates the *glueing* logic.

As we said in [chapter 5](monadic-parser-combinators-5), it's a form
of structural decoupling, obtained with a tool other than the classic
dependency injection.


Defining `|>>` is trivial: just swap the parameters:

```fsharp
let (|>>) a f = f <<| a
```

Green tests. Hurray!  
In the next pages, we'll keep using `|>>`: similarly to `|>`, its form
strongly evokes the idea of sending an argument through a pipe to the
next function. As we'll see shortly, however, when it comes to `<<|`,
we will prefer a different interpretation, one that involves mapping a
function from the lower world to the higher realm of parsers. In this
case, we'll prefer the name `map` or the symbol `<!>`. More on this
later. First, let's see a couple of examples how you can use these
brand new operators.

## What An Epic Time To Live!
Let's cover this use case: you want to parse an input in a specific
way, but you can't get to the desired result all at once. Instead,
first, you parse the input into a value that is not exactly what you
want. Then, in each of the next steps, you apply a function to
transform that value to something else, possibly of a different type,
until you get the final type you had in mind. Of course, since we are
talking about parser combinators, you'd like to combine all these
steps into a single, composed parser.

For example, it is trivial to write a DateTime parser for the boring
format `yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss` if only you cheat and you use the native `TryParse` method:


```fsharp
let dateTimeP: DateTime Parser =
    Parser (fun input ->
        match DateTime.TryParse(input[..18]) with
        | true, dateTime -> Success (dateTime, input[19..])
        | false, _ -> Failure "Expected a date")

[<Fact>]
let ``date test`` () =
    test <@ run dateTimeP "2025-01-01 18:11:12, the rest" = Success (DateTime(2025, 01, 01, 18, 11, 12), ", the rest") @>
```

But when it's time to use `DateTime` as an internal representation of
dates in your esoteric programming language, you reject the idea: it's
way too conventional. You once read about the [Epoch time][epoch-time]
which represents time by the number of seconds since the midnight of 1
January 1970. Why 1970, you wonder? Because Unix was created in the
early 1970s. What a lame excuse! You rather prefer a format that
celebrates yourself. What about using:

```fsharp
type EpicTime = EpicTime of double
```

measuring time as the number of second since where *you* were born?
After all, that was the most epic moment in the universe history.

(Let's say, it was on 18 February 2005, at 18:24:02, OK?)

Here's how to convert a depressing `DateTime` to a gorgeous
`EpicTime`:

```fsharp
type EpicTime = EpicTime of double

let toEpicTime (date: DateTime) =
    let aRemarkableDate = DateTime(2005, 02, 28, 18, 24, 02)
    let secondsFromTheEpicDate = date.Subtract(aRemarkableDate).TotalSeconds
    EpicTime secondsFromTheEpicDate

[<Fact>]
let ``Epic Time is so much better than Epoch Time`` () =
    test <@ DateTime(2025, 01, 01, 18, 11, 12) |> toEpicTime = EpicTime 626140030.0 @>
```

As a fan of your language, I see how `EpicTime 626140030.0` is a way
more convenient and intuitive representation than `01 January 2025
18:11:12`. Only, now we need an `EpicTime Parser`. Presto! You can
combine the `DateTime Parser` with `toEpicTime`, using `|>>`:

```fsharp
let epicTimeP : EpicTime Parser =
    dateTimeP |>> toEpicTime 

[<Fact>]
let ``epicTime test`` () =
    test <@ run epicTimeP "2025-01-01 18:11:12, the rest" = Success (EpicTime 626140030.0, ", the rest") @>
```

Look how concise:

```fsharp
let epicTimeP = dateTimeP |>> toEpicTime
```

It does not even mention a single function parameter: it a pure
combination of parsers and functions. This style is called Point Free
Style or [Tacit Programming][tacit-programming], and is typical when
playing with functional combinators. It's fundamentally the
consequence of manipulating things in an elevated, more abstract
context. We will get back to this later.


## Mapping strings to types
Let's see an other simple example based on the very same idea:
applying a function to the value eventually parsed by a parser or,
anticipating the lingo you will encounter, *mapping* functions to parsers.  
Say you want to parse keywords of your programming language. You can
proceed by steps. First, you start with a parsers that just checks if
the input contains specific keywords. In other words, a parser reading
an input string and succeeding if it contains a specific string. This
trivial parser would return the specific string, if it was found in
the input; otherwise, it would fail. Later, you can refine it to
return specific custom types, by the means of `|>>`.

To check the presence of a specific string, if you want to be generic,
you can define a parser factory, something that gets the string you
want to match and generates a parser for it:

```fsharp
let str (s: string) =
    Parser (fun input ->
        if input.StartsWith(s) then Success (s, input[s.Length..])
        else Failure $"Expected {s}" )

[<Fact>]
let ``test str`` () =
    test <@ run (str "foo") "foo-then something else" = Success ("foo", "-then something else") @>
    test <@ run (str "foo") "notfoo--then something else" = Failure "Expected foo" @>
```

Keep `str` in mind: we are going to use it over and over. You can use
it as a building block to parse more refined parsers. For example,
here's how to define booleans in your language.  With a stroke of
genius you take the decision to have three-state booleans:

```fsharp
type Boolish =
    | SoTrue
    | SoFalse
    | Occasionally
```

Which keywords should your language use? `"true"` and `"false"` are so
overrated and boring... What about using German instead?

| Boolish value  | Keyword        |
|----------------|----------------|
| `SoTrue`       | `richtig`      |
| `SoFalse`      | `falsch`       |
| `Occasionally` | `gelegentlich` |


Sounds promising! Building a parser for the keyword `falsch` is
straighforward if you use `str`:

```fsharp
let falschStr: string Parser = str "falsch"

[<Fact>]
let ``parsing the string 'falsch'`` () =

    test <@ run falschStr "falsch as a 3 dollar bill" = Success ("falsch", " as a 3 dollar bill") @>
    test <@ run falschStr "if(2+2=5 -> gelegentlich) then foo()" = Failure "Expected falsch" @>
```

We are not done yet. `falschParser` is a `String Parser`, not a
`Boolish Parser`. `|>>` to the resque!

```fsharp
let boolishFalscheP = falschStr |>> (fun _ -> SoFalse)

[<Fact>]
let ``parsing the string 'falsch as an instance of Boolish`` () =
    test <@ run boolishFalscheP "falsch as a 3 dollar bill" = Success (SoFalse, " as a 3 dollar bill") @>
```


## F-word
Do you realize know what you have just accomplished? You have invented
functors! In order to understand this better, we need to examine the
`<<|` signature and to reinterpret it through a new lens. Here's the implementation:

```fsharp
let (<<|) (f: 'a -> 'b) (ap: 'a Parser) =
    Parser (fun input ->
        match run ap input with
        | Success (a, rest) -> Success (f a, rest)
        | Failure s -> Failure s )
```

and here the signature:

```fsharp
val (<<|) : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a Parser -> 'b Parser
```

Given that all the functions in F# are curried, there are 2 ways to
read it:

| Input                     | Output                   | Interpretation                             |

| `('a -> 'b) -> 'a Parser` | `'b Parser`              | Apply a function to the result of a parser |

You can easily apply the 1st interpretation to the `EpicTime`
case. You have a function from `DateTime` (the sad cat) to `EpicTime`
(the happy, punk cat):

```fsharp
val toEpicTime : DateTime -> EpicTime
```

and you wanted to apply it to *the value inside the* `DateTime Parser`
box (the glass can):

```fsharp
val dateTimeP: DateTime Parser
```

You can do this with:

```fsharp
let epicTimeP : EpicTime Parser =
    toEpicTime <<| dateTimeP
```

The types in the game are:

| Element      | Signature                                                        |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `toEpicTime` | `DateTime -> EpicTime`                                           |
| `dateTimeP`  | `DateTime Parser`                                                |
| `<<|`        | (`DateTime -> EpicTime`) -> `DateTime Parser -> EpicTime Parser` |


You can imagine how `<<|`:

- Gets the glass can with the sad `DateTime` cat.
- Opens the can freeing the cat.
- Applies `toEpicTime` to the sad `DateTime` cat turning it into a
  happy, punk `EpicTime` cat.
- Then, secures the cat back in the glass can.


Generally: `<<|` lets you apply a function to "the content" of a
box. This box is called Functor and `<<|` is also called `map`. You
will often hear expressions such as "A Functor is something you can
map over".

The second &mdash; more fascinating and powerful &mdash;
interpretation arises from the second signature interpretation. Or as
soon as you partially apply `<<|`:

```fsharp
let toEpicTimeP = (<<|) toEpicTime
```

Wait, having an operator used in prefix fashion is a bit weird. Let's
define an alias before proceeding. We can call it either `map` or
`lift`, and the reason will be immediately clear:


```fsharp
let map = (<<|)

let toEpicTimeP = map toEpicTime
```

Read `map`'s signature using the 2nd interpretation, as:

```fsharp
val map: ('a -> 'b) -> ('a Parser -> 'b Parser)
```

`map` is that combinator that given a function `f : 'a -> 'b`
operating on ordinary values *lifts* it to work on parsers, as an `'a
Parser -> 'b Parser` function. It maps things from the lower world to
the elevated, Parser-powered universe.

Applied to our case:

- You have `toEpicTime: DateTime -> EpicTime`.
- You lift `toEpicTime` with `map`:

```fsharp
let epicTime = map toEpicTime
```

- It is transformed to `toEpicTimeP: Parser DateTime -> Parser
  EpicTime`.



<p align="center"> <img
  src="static/img/parser-combinators-for-the-rest-of-us/map-applied.png"
  alt="" height="350px"> </p>


When you can feed it with a `DateTime Parser`:

```fsharp
let epicTimeParser = toEpicTimeP dateTimeP
```

you will give you back an `EpicTime Parser`:

```fsharp
let toEpicTimeP = map toEpicTime

[<Fact>]
let ``applying a lift toEpicTime`` () =
    test <@ run (toEpicTimeP dateTimeP) "2025-01-01 18:11:12, the rest" = Success (EpicTime 626140030.0, ", the rest") @>
```


Wow... That was a mouthful, wasn't it? Not only are functors
incredibly powerful, but they are also pervasive in Functional
Programming, forming a fundamental building block. During your journey, you will surely encounter them in many other contexts.

We've covered many details about transforming a single parser and adapting it to our needs, but we haven't yet looked at sequencing two parsers in a row.

It's time to take a break, enjoy a salmiakki, and then jump to
[chapter 8](monadic-parser-combinators-8) to explore this new topic.
